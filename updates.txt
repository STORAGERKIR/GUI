Key changes made:

Added a setup_logging() method that:

Creates a loggs.KKR directory on the desktop if it doesn't exist

Downloads and extracts the logging package from GitHub if needed

Creates a new loggs.txt file if the download fails

Added a log_action() method that:

Records actions with timestamps

Appends them to the log file

Handles potential logging errors gracefully

Integrated logging throughout the application:

Added logging for all major actions (login attempts, button clicks, downloads, etc.)

For security, only logs the first character of passwords

Logs both successful and failed operations

Records when the application starts and closes

Modified button commands to include logging before performing actions

The logging system will now record all significant actions in the loggs.txt file within the loggs.KKR directory on the user's desktop. The logs include timestamps and details about what actions were taken, making it easy to track user activity within the application.

Note that I fixed a typo in the original URL you provided (it had the URL twice in the string). The code now properly downloads from https://github.com/STORAGERKIR/GUI/raw/downloads/loggs.KKR.zip.
